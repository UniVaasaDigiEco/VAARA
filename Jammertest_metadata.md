- Duration=2024-09-11 10:06:00 - 2024-09-11 10:16:54 (CET)
- Annex 2.3.1
- Planned Test 2.6.1 at 10:00 AM
    - At the start of the test, we are 30m from the spoof position.
    - Test start at 10:06. The spoofing only lasted for about a minute, as a small amplifier was broken. The test was not conducted because we were waiting for a new amplifier to be brought down from the mountain. Instead, we moved on to the next test.

## Test: 2.6.2 
- Name: Spoofer (in vehicle with roof mounted antenna) stationary and then moving with fixed spoofed position.
- Duration=2024-09-11 08:59:59 - 2024-09-11 09:22:17 (UTC)
- Duration=2024-09-11 10:59:59 - 2024-09-11 11:22:17 (CET)
- Annex 2.3.2
- Test 2.6.2 at 11:00
    - 10 minutes at a stationary position, 30m from the spoof position.
    - Started driving at 11:10:10.
    - Speed: 50 km/h, though the test catalog states 40 km/h.
    - The map in the car shows the car jumping back and forth in the same place. The position on the map is several kilometers behind the actual position on the road. The position on the map suddenly jumps back to Stave and shows the car driving in the opposite direction. The map indicates that the car is on the road the entire time. The car’s position remains fixed at Stave and jumps back and forth towards the north. The car searches for a GPS signal. It’s possible the car’s wheels are indicating it’s moving either forward or backward but not in which direction.
    - The car’s clock was also affected, showing one hour earlier than the actual time.
    - Test end at 11:22.
    - Duration: 22 minutes and 18 seconds.
After the spoofer was turned off, the car’s GPS could not find the correct position and continued searching for a signal. Even 23 minutes after the test ended, the car still had not found a GPS signal. The car never regained the signal before the next test.

## Test: 2.6.3 
- Name: Spoofer (in vehicle with roof mounted antenna) moving with fixed spoofed position.

- Duration=2024-09-11 11:51:00 - 2024-09-11 12:07:42 (CET)
- Annex 2.3.3
- Test 2.6.3 ("Sea Spoofing") at 11:50
    - Speed: 50 km/h, though the test catalog states 40 km/h.
    - The car’s clock jumped to a new time, showing two hours earlier than the actual time. It is suspected this happened because the position jumped to a different time zone.
    - The car’s GPS position was several miles out to sea. It appears the position is stationary on the water, but it is difficult to tell on the map. Note: At the start of the test, the GPS did not show the correct position at Stave, as it was still spoofed from the previous test. The position moved to the sea when the new spoofer for this test was activated.
    - Began driving at 11:55, 5 minutes into the test due to the reorganization of cars in the convoy.
    - Test stop at 12:07.
    - Duration: 16 minutes and 14 seconds.
    - After the spoofer was turned off, the GPS still could not find a signal and continued searching.

- Annex 2.3.4
- Test 2.6.1 - Attempted to start test at 12:30, actual test start at 12:31
    - This test was conducted instead of test 2.6.4 due to limited time before lunch, and this test is stationary.
    - Attempted test start at 12:30.
    - Actual test start at 12:31.
    - The position began in the sea from the previous test. At 12:31, the car’s map found the correct position, but the clock was still 2.5 hours behind the actual time. The direction changed several times. In the last minutes of the test, the position moved further down the road.
    - Test end at 12:51.
    - Duration: 20 minutes.
    - When the spoofer was turned off during this test, the car was stationary, and the signal returned immediately. In previous tests, the spoofer was turned off while the car was moving, and the signal did not return when the spoofing was stopped.
    - Test 2.6.4 - Was not conducted, see the explanation in the previous test 2.6.1
